    - accordion: default folders & Aside / Reminders (unified for accounts) | Account folders | IMAP Folders per account when selected
- Starr folders (Aside): 1) default ones and 2) user-starred / collapse imap folders



#### MAIL

- MULTI Account handling /ADD to Folders:

- SPAM Logic?
-- Select ALL in a folder (EmailList) and make deletion possible? OR: junk/spam -> add clear button (autoclean)
- Move mails into folders
